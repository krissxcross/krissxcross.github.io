All information about this table-top roleplaying game (e.g. character creation aspects, game mechanics, game / system terminology, etc.) will be hosted on this website for free of charge. I feel as though this tidbit should be emphasized: <b>this game system is in very early development,</b> meaning everything featured on this page has yet to be tested and can be modified/removed at any moment! Please understand and acknowledge this as you view the pages, and enjoy your visit!<br>~ Oli of the Sinfonia System<br>(P.S. the initial version of this website won't be optimized for mobile browsers. sorry)</p>
